# Critical Ops Menu

Mod Menu built using **[PolarImGui](https://github.com/Polarmods/PolarImGui)** 
 
Includes a poor memcheck bypass, and a POC Esp, aswell as some simple mods.

Use Lucky Patcher to bypass the signature check.

There are other checks that you'll have to bypass, and you need to update the base.
